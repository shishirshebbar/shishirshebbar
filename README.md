I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** with a passion for building dynamic and responsive web applications. I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, leveraging modern frameworks and technologies like **React**, **Next.js**, and **Node.js** to create scalable, user-friendly solutions.

Currently, I'm focusing on enhancing my skills in **Web Development**, exploring the world of **Machine Learning** to integrate intelligent systems into applications, and diving into **DevOps** to better understand infrastructure automation and cloud deployment.

With a strong foundation in **software development**, I'm always excited to learn and grow, working on new projects and technologies to solve real-world problems.
