# About Me

I'm a full stack developer with a focus on building real-time, collaborative, and AI-powered web applications.  
I enjoy working across the stack—from designing clean, functional frontends to building scalable backend systems.  
Most of my work revolves around modern web frameworks, distributed caching, and tools that make real-time collaboration possible.
