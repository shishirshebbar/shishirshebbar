I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** with a passion for building dynamic and responsive web applications.  
I work on both the front-end and back-end, using frameworks and technologies like **React**, **Next.js**, **FastAPI** and **Node.js** to create scalable and user-friendly solutions.

In my projects and internships, I’ve applied concepts from **AI/ML** and **DevOps** to build efficient and production-ready systems.  
I have hands-on experience with **distributed caching**, **Redis**, and **Docker-hosted databases**, which help improve performance and scalability in my applications.

I enjoy learning new technologies, exploring different architectures, and building solutions that solve real-world problems.
